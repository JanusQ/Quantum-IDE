    "The hardware": "The hardware of this platform quantum computer is based on the superconducting quantum computing team of Zhejiang University. After more than ten years of construction, the team has accumulated rich technology in the design, preparation, measurement, and control of superconducting quantum chips, and has developed 10-qubit, 20-qubit, and 30-qubit superconducting quantum chips in recent years, and has achieved fruitful research results.  In 2017, the team generated the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinge state on the 10-bit superconducting quantum chip [1]. In 2019, the team achieved 20 qubits of the Schrödinger cat state [2], and the results were published in Science. In 2021, the team released two superconducting quantum chips with excellent performance, 'Tianmu 1' and 'Mogan 1', in collaboration with Hangzhou International Science and Technology Center. In the same year, the team achieved multi-body localization on the 'Mogan 1' quantum chip [3], which surpassed the limit of what can be simulated by classical computing resources. The results were published in the journal [1]. In addition, the team has conducted in-depth research in quantum machine learning, quantum error mitigation, quantum optics, and quantum line error calibration.In the same year, the team reported a unique type of non-equilibrium state of matter with Floquet symmetry protection in topology, which was realized through digital quantum simulation of programmable superconducting qubit arrays [4]. The results were published in the Nature journal. Later, the team proved the existence of the quantum topological structure of light and showed how to observe this topological structure using specific experimental methods. Finally, some new conclusions were drawn about the quantum topological structure of light, which are important for a better understanding of the properties and behavior of light [5]. The results were published in the Science journal.",
    "This platform": "This platform of quantum computer software and algorithm relies on the Institute of Computer System Architecture (CCNT Lab) in the School of Computer Science of Zhejiang University, which is dedicated to the research and development of new generation computing technologies and systems. The team has a strong research foundation in the fields of service computing and distributed computing, computer architecture, and programming languages. In the field of quantum computing, after more than one year of accumulation, we have designed and improved the quantum measurement and control software together with the School of Physics, which can improve the measurement and control efficiency by more than 10 times; assisted the new laboratory of Innovation Research Institute in the equipment construction and software debugging of quantum computers; designed the Quantum Computing Simulator V1.0, which can provide users with a web-based quantum circuit compiler to realize quantum algorithms to quantum circuit compilation. In the future, we will work on quantum computing simulator, quantum operating system, quantum algorithms and applications, actively promote quantum algorithm-related applications, and strengthen cross-disciplinary research on quantum computing and artificial intelligence, medicine, chemistry, finance, sociology, etc.",
